    "I was trying to finetune a object detection model on a custom dataset. I was looking for example code for the same, but most examples I could find were for classification. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Features:** After feature extraction, classification is straightforward as it is just a fully connected layer on top of the extracted features. But for object detection (say YOLO), the features we extract are in the shape `S X S X B X (5 + C)`, where S is the grid size, B is the number of bounding boxes per grid cell, 5 is the bounding box coordinates and objectness score, and C is the number of classes. Here S X S is the grid size, to which we want to divide the image. \n",
    "- **Loss Computation:** After bounding box generation during training time, the loss computation is also different. We need to compute the loss for the bounding box coordinates, objectness score, and class prediction. \n",
    "- **Dataset Formats:** There are several formats in which the labels and bounding boxes are represented. `Roboflow`, makes it easy to convert between these formats.\n",
    "- At inference time, from all the bounding boxes generated, we need to select the bounding boxes with the highest objectness score and then apply non-max suppression to remove overlapping bounding boxes.\n",
